        <h3>Deleted Email Recovery</h3>
<p>By default, any email deleted from your mailbox goes through the following process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The email is moved to your Deleted Items folder.</li>
  <li>If you purge or remove items from your Deleted Items folder, they are moved to the Dumpster where they are still recoverable.</li>
  <li>The Dumpster only holds email messages for 14 days once they've been removed from Deleted Items.</li>
  <li>Deleted email can be recovered from the Deleted Items folder or the Dumpster. Once it has been permanently deleted from the dumpster, it cannot be recovered.</li>
</ol>
<p>How to Recover Deleted Items from the Dumpster:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the Deleted Items folder.</li>
  <li>Under the Home tab, choose Recover Deleted Items from Server.</li>
  <li>Choose the email that needs to be recovered (you can choose more than one).</li>
  <li>Choose Restore Selected Items and click OK.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Deleted email can be recovered from the Deleted Items folder or the Dumpster. Once it has been permanently deleted from the dumpster, it cannot be recovered. Also, Deleted Email Recovery is only available in OWA or Outlook.</p>

<h3>H Drive Read and Write Access</h3>

<p>A. Read Access – This is by default provided to users with H drive provisioning.</p>
<p>B. Write Access – After the OneDrive migration, write access is no longer default for users. </p>
<p>
In the default setup, Home Drive has limited access permissions, specifically Read Only (R/O). It is not possible to store any data on Home Drive (H:), except for the folders that have been approved for Application data, which include System and Explorer/Favorites. These approved folders grant Read and Write (R/W) access.</p>
<p>Additional information can be found here: <a href="#">H: Drive Permissions</a></p>
<p>Examples of application folders are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>H:\DATA\SapLogon</li>
    <li>H:\ESOPS</li>
</ul>
<p>Request for access to H drive application folders can be placed here: <a href="#">H: Drive Permissions Request Form</a></p>
